# Final Project 

For my final project I will be building an arcade machine with a coin operator. 

I chose this project because I love video games and it all stems back to my earlier years of going to an old arcade. I loved the environment and want to catch some of that nostalgia of putting coin in a slot and pressing start. 

From what I have seen the possible problems I can see consist of everything. I have to become acquainted to a raspberry pi well beyond what was skimmed, become familiar with soldering and wiring. I must also be able to acquire all the parts in a timely fashion so this will be an expensive (I believe) endeavor. 

I plan to watch many videos elaborating on the pieces and wiring that I will need. As well as how to properly utilize the raspberry pi to fully contain all the video games I miss from my childhood and even those I missed out on. 

I believe this project will help me in my career in gaining dexterity so I can finally build my own custom PC to do all the coding and programming for my own video game.
